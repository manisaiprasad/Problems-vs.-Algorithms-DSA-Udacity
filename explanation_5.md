# Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

Time complexity of searching and inserting from a trie depends on the length of the word a thatâ€™s being searched for, inserted, and the number of total words, n, making the runtime of these operations O(a*n). 
The space complexity of a trie, the worst case, would be when we have a word (or words), with no common characters between them, hence having, a node for each letter. Resulting in a space complexity of O(n).
