# Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

I had to string clean the path by removing outside occurences of / with strip and then split it.

#### Add Handler Method
Time Complexity: O(n) Each part of the path needs to be iterated through
Space Complexity: O(n) A new TrieNode is created for each part of the path

#### Lookup Method
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) No additional memory is allocated
